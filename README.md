cerulean
========

Node.js QWERTY instrument inspired by the Samchillian Tip Tip Tip Cheeepeeeee

### Concept

As opposed to a 'traditional' keyboard which has fixed-pitch keys; the keys of a cerulean are relative. This means that each key alters the previous pitch played by a predetermined number of notes. See `config.json` for the default keyboard layout.
